# Crash Dumps
If a crash occurs, the dumps can usually be found in the app's user data folder:
<code><user data folder>\EBWebView\Crashpad\reports</code>
The <user data folder> is created in the app's folder by default:
<code><app folder>\<app name>.exe.WebView2</code>
But apps can specify different user data folders. If they do, they generally know where it is.
